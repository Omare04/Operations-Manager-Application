Significantly improves a company's operations in both its medical evacuation and maintenance sectors through robust stock management and order control.

**Stock Management**This system provides a streamlined solution for tracking and managing real items in inventory. It allows the company to monitor the quantity, location, and status of their physical assets, ensuring efficient resource allocation and preventing shortages or overstocking. The backbone of this functionality is a meticulously designed and integrated database schema in MySQL, which powers the system's inventory management.

**Order Management**The application empowers the company to effortlessly create, modify, and track purchase orders for necessary supplies and equipment. This functionality ensures a smooth procurement process, enhancing the organization and readiness of both sectors.

**Medical Evacuation Planning**Our software enables effective planning and execution of medical evacuation missions. Users can input critical mission details such as medications, equipment, crew members, and flight information, facilitating seamless mission coordination.

**Technology Stack**To ensure reliability and user-friendliness, we employed React for the front end and Node.js for the back end, with Express.js as the framework. Secure user authentication and authorization are implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

**Deployment**During the initial phase, we hosted the platform on AWS for scalability and performance. Later, we seamlessly transferred it to the company's servers for ongoing use.
